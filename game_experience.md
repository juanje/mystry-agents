# The Game Experience

This document describes what it's like to play a mystery party game generated by Mystery Agents. The goal is to create a night of roleplay, intrigue, and deduction fully customized for you and your group of friends, where fun is guaranteed and no one is left out.

## The Concept: A Two-Act Mystery

Mystery Agents games aren't like typical static mystery parties. Instead of sitting down to read a script, participants live the story in real time. The game is divided into two acts, separated by a dramatic event:

- **Act 1: The Party** - Players socialize, roleplay their characters, negotiate, and try to fulfill secret objectives. The tension builds gradually.
- **Act 2: The Investigation** - A murder occurs! The tone of the game changes completely, and the party transforms into a frantic investigation to discover the culprit.

## The Roles: Who's Who?

Games generated by Mystery Agents are designed for a group of players (the suspects) and a host (who has the most dynamic role).

### The Host (You!): The Protagonist

Your role is the most special and fun. You don't just read instructions; you're a central part of the game, playing two distinct roles:

1. **In Act 1, you are the VICTIM** - You'll receive a light character sheet to play the party host. You can socialize, talk with your guests (the future suspects), and enjoy the roleplay, knowing your fate is sealed.

2. **In Act 2, you are the DETECTIVE** - After your "death" (managed by you), you rejoin the game with a new character: the brilliant detective (think Hercule Poirot or Benoit Blanc) who arrives to solve the case.

As the detective, your new mission is to guide the investigation. Your guide will tell you which clues to deliver and when. If you see your players are stuck, you'll have a list of "key questions" to ask, reigniting the intrigue and ensuring the game never stalls.

**The great advantage:** You play all night! First as the center of the party, and then as the charismatic director of the investigation.

### The Players (Your Guests): The Suspects

Your guests (between 4 and 10) are the heart of the mystery. Each one will receive their material **a few days before the party**. This individual package includes:

- **An invitation letter** - Summons them to your party and sets the tone
- **Their character sheet** - With public and private information, relationships, and secrets
- **Costume suggestion** - Ideas for accessories or clothing to help them get into character
- **Act 1 Objectives** - Goals they should try to accomplish during the party (e.g., "Get the Colonel to return the money he owes you," "Discover who's blackmailing the Countess")

One of them is the murderer. Mystery Agents creates a logical plot where several characters have a solid motive, but only one had the opportunity and means.

**Does the Killer Know?**

You can choose between two game modes:

- **Killer doesn't know (default)**: No player knows if they're the murderer until the final reveal. This creates equal tension for everyone, as all players suspect themselves and each other equally. It's perfect for groups that prefer surprise and intrigue.

- **Killer knows their identity**: The killer receives confidential instructions in their character sheet explaining what they did and how. This allows them to actively work to avoid detection, create false leads, and enjoy the psychological challenge of staying in character while hiding their guilt. It's ideal for players who enjoy strategic deception and roleplaying.

Both modes work equally well — it's a matter of your group's preference and playstyle.

## The Game Flow, Step by Step

Here's how a typical game night would unfold:

### 1. Preparation (Days Before)

You run Mystery Agents with your preferences (e.g., "1920s," "family mansion," "comedic tone," 6 players). The system generates all files. You receive the **Host Guide** (with all secrets) and **individual packages** (in PDF and Markdown) for each player. You send each guest their personal package.

### 2. Act 1 - The Party

Your guests arrive, many already dressed for the occasion! You read the **Act 1 Introduction Script** to set the atmosphere. You begin playing your victim character. The party begins: players try to fulfill their objectives, alliances form, accusations arise, and secrets are revealed.

### 3. The Event - The Murder!

At the climactic moment (your guide will tell you when), you follow the instructions for the event. For example: "Ask for a moment of silence for a toast, turn off the lights..." When the lights come back on, you announce your own "death." Your role as victim has ended.

### 4. Act 2 - The Investigation

You take a brief pause and read the **Act 2 Introduction Script**. You make your triumphant entrance as the Detective! The atmosphere changes. Your new Detective sheet guides you. "I found this letter in the victim's pocket," you say, handing out Clue 1. You begin interrogating the suspects, using your "guiding questions" if necessary.

### 5. The Grand Reveal

Once all players have made their final accusation, you take the floor as the Detective. You read the complete solution explaining who the murderer was, how they did it, and why, connecting all the clues your guests discovered.

## What Makes This Experience Unique?

- **Fully Customized** - The story, characters, and culprit are generated for your specific group. No two games are alike.
- **Immersion from Day One** - Players receive their role before the party, creating anticipation and ensuring everyone arrives ready to play.
- **No One is Eliminated** - Unlike other games, the host doesn't get bored. They transform into the most active and fun role in the second half of the game.
- **A Coherent Story** - Mystery Agents ensures the mystery is logically sound. Clues point to the culprit, and the solution is always deducible and satisfying.
- **You Play Too** - As host, you have the unique opportunity to be a character, experience the tension, and then enjoy directing the investigation as the star detective.
