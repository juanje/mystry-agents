- Country: {state.config.country}
- Summary: {state.world.summary if state.world else "Mystery party setting"}

NOTE: The victim (host's Act 1 character) will be created later. Focus on creating interesting suspects who would naturally be at this location.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Tone: {GAME_TONE_STYLE}
- Total suspects: {state.config.players.total}
{gender_constraints if gender_constraints else "- No specific gender requirements"}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create exactly {state.config.players.total} characters in the "characters" array
2. Each character MUST have ALL of these fields:
   - name, gender, age_range, role, public_description
   - personality_traits: array of at least 3-5 personality traits (e.g., ["clever", "suspicious", "charming", "manipulative", "loyal"])
   - relation_to_victim, personal_secrets (at least 2-3 secrets), personal_goals (at least 1-2 goals)
   - act1_objectives: array of 2-3 specific actionable tasks for Act 1 (REQUIRED)
   - motive_for_crime, costume_suggestion
3. All character names MUST be appropriate for {state.config.country}
4. Characters should fit naturally into the world setting ({safe_get_world_location_name(state)}) and epoch ({safe_get_world_epoch(state)})
5. Relationships between characters will be created by a separate agent later

Return the response in the exact JSON format specified in the system prompt.
