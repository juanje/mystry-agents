- Region: {state.config.region if state.config.region else "N/A"}
- Theme: {state.config.theme}
- Tone: {GAME_TONE_STYLE}

CHARACTERS:
{characters_info}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. **CRITICAL**: Create AT LEAST {min_relationships} relationships (minimum 2-3 per character)
2. **MANDATORY**: Every character MUST appear in at least 2 relationships (either as from_character_id or to_character_id)
3. Create diverse relationship types: family, romantic, professional, rivalry, friendship, other
4. At least 50% of relationships should have tension_level 2 or 3 (high drama)
5. Consider the setting, epoch, and character roles when creating relationships
6. Make relationships that will create interesting dynamics and potential conflicts during the mystery
7. Each relationship needs:
   - from_character_id: ID of first character (must match a character ID above EXACTLY)
   - to_character_id: ID of second character (must match a character ID above EXACTLY)
   - type: "family" | "romantic" | "professional" | "rivalry" | "friendship" | "other"
   - description: Specific, evocative description (e.g., "Former business partners who had a bitter falling out over a failed shipping deal", NOT just "business partners")
   - tension_level: 1 (low), 2 (medium), or 3 (high) - prefer 2 or 3 for better gameplay
8. Relationships should reveal character depth and create natural conflicts
9. Mix symmetric relationships (mutual) with asymmetric ones (one-sided feelings or power dynamics)
10. Ensure no character is isolated - all must be connected to the social web

**IMPORTANT**: The richer the relationship network, the more engaging the mystery party will be. Aim for depth and complexity.

Return the response in the exact JSON format specified in the system prompt.
