WORLD CONTEXT:
- Country: {state.config.country} (use culturally appropriate weapons, methods, and items)
- Epoch: {safe_get_world_epoch(state)}
- Location: {safe_get_world_location_name(state)} ({safe_get_world_location_type(state)})
- Setting: {state.world.summary if state.world else "Mystery party setting"}

CHARACTERS ({len(state.characters)} suspects):
{chr(10).join(characters_summary)}

CONFIGURATION:
- Target language: {state.config.language} (but generate in ENGLISH - translation will happen later)
- Host gender: {state.config.host_gender} (victim MUST be this gender)
- Tone: {GAME_TONE_STYLE}
- Difficulty: {state.config.difficulty}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a "crime" object with victim, murder_method, crime_scene, time_of_death_approx, possible_weapons, and possible_opportunities
2. The victim MUST be the HOST's Act 1 character - design them as someone central to the setting
3. The victim's gender MUST be "{state.config.host_gender}" to match the host
4. The victim should have a clear role (e.g., mansion owner, CEO, ship captain) and interesting secrets
5. IMPORTANT: The victim's name MUST be appropriate for {state.config.country}. Use authentic names from that country's culture and naming conventions.
6. The murder method must be one of: "stabbing", "poison", "shooting", "blunt_force", or "other"
7. The weapon and method should be culturally and historically appropriate for {state.config.country} in {safe_get_world_epoch(state)}
8. Consider the characters' relationships and motives when designing the crime
9. The crime should create interesting dynamics between the suspects
10. The time_of_death_approx must be in HH:MM format (e.g., "22:30")
11. All string fields must have values - do not leave any empty
12. For possible_opportunities: You can now create opportunities using character IDs from the characters list, or use an empty array []
13. For possible_weapons: Include weapons found at the scene that are culturally appropriate

Return the response in the exact JSON format specified in the system prompt.
