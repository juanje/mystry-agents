HISTORICAL & CULTURAL REQUIREMENTS (ALL MUST BE SATISFIED):
1. **Location Authenticity**: The setting MUST be in {location_spec} - use the specific geography, climate, and landscape of this region
2. **Epoch Accuracy**: ALL elements (technology, transportation, currency, social norms, fashion) MUST be appropriate for {epoch_desc}
3. **Regional Culture**: Cultural details (foods, drinks, customs) MUST be authentic to {location_spec} as it was during {epoch_desc}
4. **Architecture**: Building style and visual elements MUST reflect {location_spec}'s architecture during {epoch_desc}
5. **Fashion & Dress**: Clothing and social dress codes appropriate for {location_spec} during {epoch_desc}
6. **Items & Weapons**: Only include items/weapons that would have existed and been culturally appropriate in {location_spec} during {epoch_desc}

8. **Historical Context**: Consider major historical events or social conditions affecting {location_spec} during {epoch_desc}
9. **NO Anachronisms**: Do not include technology, terms, or concepts that didn't exist in {epoch_desc}
10. **NO Regional Mixing**: If a region is specified, do NOT use cultural elements from other regions of {state.config.country}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a "world" object with epoch, location_type, location_name, summary, gathering_reason, visual_keywords, and constraints
2. The world should be rich in detail and feel authentic to {state.config.country} in the {state.config.epoch} era
3. The gathering_reason must explain WHY all these people are at this location tonight (e.g., family event, memorial service, celebration, business meeting, ceremony)
4. Include cultural elements that will inform character creation, costume suggestions, and crime details later
5. The location should be suitable for a mystery party with {state.config.players.total} suspects
6. All string fields must have values - do not leave any empty
7. Visual keywords should reflect the cultural and historical atmosphere

Return the response in the exact JSON format specified in the system prompt.
